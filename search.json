    "text": "I spent a long time developing software for business tasks in various domains, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of data science and software engineering. I am available for remote consulting work. I can work with your data science team on the following tasks:\n\nApplying data science to understand and extract insights from operational data.\nWorking with your data science team on framing business problems in terms of data science and machine learning. Translating business KPIs into model metrics and vice versa takes experience and practice. I have worked with data science teams in the past to help them with this translation.\nSummarizing and visualizing data science results for business stakeholders. This again requires experience and practice.\nModel and complexity management. What is the right level of model complexity for a given business problem? How do we refine and improve models over time? Doing this with a satisficing perspective takes experience and practice.\nSummarizing your data assets to inform the problems that you are interested in solving. Organizations collect vast quantitites of data over time. Summarizing these data assets so that key insights make their way into model iterations is a continuos process. There have been many developments in this area in the past decade (see this playlist ). However, picking the right approach for your data assets and business problem is not trivial. I can help you with this.\nWorking with your optimization team on interfacing machine learning and statistical models with optimization models. This is a very interesting area of research and has gained traction in the past decade. Many optimization and planning problems are stochastic in nature. They have to take uncertainty into account. This uncertainty can be modeled with machine learning and statistical models. For example, the weather can be a stochastic variable in a planning problem. If you are an agricultural company, you may want to use machine learning models to predict the weather. You can then use these predictions in your optimization models. If you are a retailer with perishable goods, you may want to use machine learning models to predict demand. You can then use these predictions to plan your inventory. Stochastic optimization is not esoteric anymore, thanks to the quality of optimization tools that are available today."

    "text": "I’m a data scientist with over 25 years of experience, and I’ve worked across a bunch of industries—retail, telecom, transport, finance, government, and software tools. I’ve got a strong background in software development, project management, and designing both software systems and data models.\nI actually started out in software development, but about 15 years ago, I naturally transitioned into machine learning as data-driven features became more important in enterprise apps. To get a better handle on this shift, I took up a Master’s in Data Science part-time, and that really sparked my interest even more.\nAfter living in the US for around 20 years, I moved back to India due to a family situation. Once here, I went all in and pursued a PhD in machine learning, where I focused on building and testing computational approaches for big data. Later, I worked on a machine learning platform specifically for graph-based learning, which ties in closely with combinatorial optimization—an area I’d already touched on earlier in my career through scheduling and capacity planning work. Looking at these problems from a graph perspective really opened up some new ways of thinking for me.\nI’m currently based in Chennai and looking for remote consulting opportunities in machine learning and optimization. If you’re working on something in these areas and open to collaborating remotely, I’d love to chat!"
