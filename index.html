	  <div style="text-align: justify;">
	  I am an engineer with a background in machine learning and software development. I worked <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}bio.html"> for a long time in the industry</a> before starting on a PhD in machine learning. I am interested in the application of machine learning to big datasets. Take a look at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}blog.html"> some of the topics</a> that have caught my attention in recent times. My <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}projects.html"> research</a> focus is in the development of practical machine learning methods for big datasets. If you are interested in research collaboration, do get in <a href="mailto:rajiv.sambasivan@gmail.com">touch</a>. If you are interested in hiring me for machine learning consulting work, get in <a href="mailto:rajiv.sambasivan@gmail.com">touch </a> too. However, I can only work with you remotely. I can consider limited travel to your location on a case by case basis - depending on your project needs, location etc..</div>
