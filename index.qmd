Hi, I am Rajiv Sambasivan. I am a seasoned data scientist with over 25 years of professional experience. I have developed data-centric software applications for the retail, financial services, transportation, government, and software tools (graph databases) domains. I spent the first ten years of my career in software application development for scheduling and capacity management. I spent the next fifteen years in data science, working on applications that performed information retrieval, data mining, and discrete optimization. By way of formal training I have a PhD in machine learning from the Chennai Mathematical Institute.
