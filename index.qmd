::: {style="text-align: justify"}

I'm a data scientist with over 25 years of experience, and I've worked across a bunch of industries—retail, telecom, transport, finance, government, and software tools. I’ve got a strong background in software development, project management, and designing both software systems and data models.

I actually started out in software development, but about 15 years ago, I naturally transitioned into machine learning as data-driven features became more important in enterprise apps. To get a better handle on this shift, I took up a Master’s in Data Science part-time, and that really sparked my interest even more.

After living in the US for around 20 years, I moved back to India due to a family situation. Once here, I went all in and pursued a PhD in machine learning, where I focused on building and testing computational approaches for big data. Later, I worked on a machine learning platform specifically for graph-based learning, which ties in closely with combinatorial optimization—an area I’d already touched on earlier in my career through scheduling and capacity planning work. Looking at these problems from a graph perspective really opened up some new ways of thinking for me.

I’m currently based in Chennai and looking for remote consulting opportunities in machine learning and optimization. If you’re working on something in these areas and open to collaborating remotely, I’d love to chat!
