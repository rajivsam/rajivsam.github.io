I wanted to try to use PCA to extract the independent components of variation in large time series data. To this end, I used the household power consumption dataset that provides voltage measurements at one minute intervals over a four year period. This data is dirty. It has missing data for 82 days in this period. So conventional auto-regressive models cannot be applied directly to the entire dataset. However, that is material for another day. A plot of the rolling mean of the voltage values using a 15 day (bi-monthly) window is shown below. Clearly, seaosonal patterns are evident.

To analyze independent patterns of variation over this four year period. I aggregated data at hourly intervals. A day is represented by a 24 hour vector. Each component of this vector represents the hourly mean voltage for that period. A sample of the dataset is shown below:

In about 5 principal components we can explain the mean hourly variations of voltage in this dataset

The first two principal components are shown below. These two components represent major variations in hourly mean voltage over this period.
