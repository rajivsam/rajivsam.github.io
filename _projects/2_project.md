<p>
I am available for data science consulting work beginning August 2023. I may be a good fit for your project, if:
<ol>
<li> The product you are interested in developing is meant to solve a problem in enterprise IT using data science. There are two situations where I can help. The first situation is if you have a business task you are trying to accomplish with data science and you have representative data for it (privacy addressed), however, you need help framing this business task as a data science problem and then evaluate and refine the data science solution to accomplish this business task. The second situation is if you have business task and an existing data science solution and are interested in addressing a specific limitation or pain point with the existing solution.</li>

<li> You are a startup with a product feature that you think can be enhanced with data science. The two situations to consider here. The first situation is if you are looking to explore and validate the idea as a proof of concept. The second situation is if you are looking to fix a limitation or pain point with a particular feature. </li>
<li> You are interested in an incremental, transparent and process based approach to solving your problem.</li>
</ol>
